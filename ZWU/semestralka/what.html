	<h1>What is the millennium bug?</h1>
<p>It is a bug that has been around since the advent of computers, yet has only begun gaining attention in the past couple years. We are of course talking about the millennium bug. Read a cyber-tale about how it all began.
</p><h2><a name="beginnings">Humble beginnings</a></h2>
<p>In the beginning there was a strange medium for storing electronic information – the punch card. As computers continued to evolve, this antique method was superseded with magnetic media, yet even the infamous floppies and hard drives didn’t help solve the most crucial problem of all – <strong>lack of data space</strong>.
</p><h2><a name="dilemma">A programmer’s dilemma</a></h2>
<p>Fast forward to the late seventies and early eighties. As personal computers began to secure a foothold in the American business, so did legions of programmers. Tackling with increasing demands from their bosses, they often had to store a <strong>huge amount of information</strong>. 
</p><p>Though technology didn’t keep up with the demands, <strong>programmer’s ingenuity</strong> helped come up with a solution. One of the ways to get the most from ample storage media was to reduce the number of repeating elements.
</p><h2><a name="future">All my troubles seem so far away</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious thing to do was to ditch the first two digits of each year, effectively doubling the available space. Everyone was happy that day and nobody bothered to <strong>look into the future</strong>. Remember, this could’ve been about a quarter century ago and programming practices have carried on since then.
</p><h2><a name="problem">The number problem</a></h2>
<p>The truth is most early developers didn’t in their wildest dreams think that portions of their software would still be in use come Year 2000. By the mid-nineties, people began wondering <strong>what would happen</strong> after the year inevitably rolled over 99. Most Y2K-prone systems proceed a century back to 1900, some create a magical wormhole all the way to 19100.
</p><p>The problem is blatantly simple, yet the effects could be unforeseen. If you fancy a <strong>good scare</strong>, head over to the next page, where we go through a couple doomsday scenarios.

	<h1>Why should I care?</h1>
	
	<p>There is a huge number of potential scenarios that might take place on the night of 1st January 2000. We went through a number of credible sources and picked three of the most interesting <strong>doomsday theories</strong>. Should you at any point of this article start feeling queasy or uneasy, don’t hesitate <a href="help.html#counseling" title="Get help from the experts! | Y2K! - the ultimate solution">to get in touch with the experts</a>.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="nuclear">Nuclear disaster</a></h2>
	<p>Atomic energy is today considered to be one of the <strong>safest ways</strong> to produce energy. Despite the catastrophic events at Chernobyl and, to a lesser extent, Three Miles Island, the modern nuclear reactor is a safe beast.
</p><p>We have to realize though that the only thing keeping the beast from unleashing terrible havoc upon the world is a complex network of computer systems. The same network that is <strong>destined to fail</strong> when the clock hits midnight.
</p><p>There is no need to explain what would happen afterwards. Cooling problems, meltdown and finally <strong>radiation poisoning</strong>. We are working with leading partners in the energy field to make sure this dangerous plot doesn’t come into fruition.
</p>

	<h2><a name="transport">Transport mayhem</a></h2>
	<p>When people think Y2K, they usually imagine planes crashing from the skies. This popular view might be pretty far from reality though as today’s aircraft contains a number of <strong>failsafe mechanisms</strong> and highly trained people in the cockpit.
</p><p>A more realistic scenario would have more to do with <strong>traffic control systems</strong>. Picture airplanes crashing into each other on the runway as they take off against each other, trains speeding into each other and cars crashing at an intersection.
</p>

	<h2><a name="finance">Financial meltdown</a></h2>
	<p>While not exactly a doomsday theory, it could prove to be a challenge nonetheless. Each and every business day, brokers gather together and shape the future of whole industries. Money rule the world. Major stock markets such as <abbr title="National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations">NASDAQ</abbr> depend on <strong>extraordinarily frequent operations</strong>, which have to be as precise as they are fast.
</p><p>Y2K could turn into a pretty tough issue in this sector with fates of multinational companies at stake. In the worst case scenario it may even bring about a <strong>global financial crisis</strong> which would negatively impact lives of everyone.

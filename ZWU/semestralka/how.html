	<h1>How can I prepare?</h1>
	<h2><a name="individual">I need help for myself</a></h2>
	<p>Updating a single computer to millennium standards is not as hard as you may think. Thankfully, this means you are able to do the most important stuff <strong>yourself</strong>! Let’s assume you are not running any specialized heavy-duty applications and do most of the work in an office suite such as Microsoft Office or IBM Lotus SmartSuite. 
</p><ul id="operatingsystem"><li>If you are running an operating system from the <strong><abbr title="Windows 95, 98, NT">Microsoft Windows</abbr></strong> family coupled with Microsoft Office 97, getting Y2K-ready is as easy as downloading the newest updates from Windows Update. Information about other Microsoft products can be found on a <a class="linkout" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990508152402/http://www.microsoft.com/y2k/" title="Microsoft TechNet - Year 2000">special Y2K section</a> of the company’s website.
</li><li>Are you a Mac person instead? Great, because the newest versions of <strong>Apple’s Mac OS</strong> operating system have been shipping Y2K-ready for quite some time now. If you are running Mac OS 8 or newer, you are all set for the next millennium. Keep in mind however, that the Y2K bug still appears in the Macintosh version of Microsoft Excel spreadsheet processor. Click the aforementioned link to find out more.
</li><li>If you are running a <strong>different operating system</strong> or perhaps any advanced applications, feel free to call our toll-free Y2K line at 1-800-Y2K-HELP. Regardless of your computer settings, you may also be interested in our selection of other Y2K wares. With our state of the art <a href="help.html#kit" title="Get help from the experts! | Y2K! - the ultimate solution">Millennium Survival Kit</a>, you will be all set for whatever is upon us on the first night of the next millennium.

	<p>If you are a fledging corporation, then you may recognize the value of your company’s data assets. Imagine the <strong>horror</strong> you could face on the fine morning of 3rd January 2000. Empty databases, malfunctioning data servers, unresponsive fax system – you name it.
</p><ul><li>If you are a <strong>small company</strong> with little to no networking, the procedure of getting Y2K-ready can be very similar to the first section of this document.
</li><li>A company with a <strong>larger number</strong> of computers and/or a greater network may first want to consult with their <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr> manufacturer. If they fail to address the issues, our <a href="help.html#onsite" title="Get help from the experts! | Y2K! - the ultimate solution">on-site team of technicians</a> shall come to your rescue.

	<p>The millennium bug can pose a <strong>serious threat</strong> to the security of vital computer systems, including but not limited to nuclear power plant facilities, airport control systems, financial services and many more. These systems are more often than not controlled via an abundance of <strong>specialized</strong> microcontrollers, many of which are prone to the bug due to their dated design.
</p><p>The complex design of such environments combined with a very <strong>limited toolset</strong> means there is very little you can do without professional help. We strongly recommend purchasing our <a href="help.html#ready" title="Get help from the experts! | Y2K! - the ultimate solution">Readiness approval service</a>, which encompasses a throughout check of all vital hardware and software by our handpicked Y2K-certified technicians.
